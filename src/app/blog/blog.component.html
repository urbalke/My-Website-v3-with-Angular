<h1>Few words about...</h1>

    <h1>Hey</h1>
    <p> This is Blog Project! My first ever attempt to use flask, integrated to CV website. <br>
        This project has separate database, templates, and provides you with ability to simply write down some stuff :)<br>
        The biggest challenge was to refractor webiste to change structure into modullar one. This project was added third into website.
